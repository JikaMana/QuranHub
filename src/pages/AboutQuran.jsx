        Journey of the Quran and Scientific Facts contained in the Qur'an

        The Quran’s journey from revelation to its current form is a testament
        to its preservation. The Quran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad
        (peace be upon him) over 23 years. It was initially memorized by the
        Prophet and his companions and recorded on materials like parchment,
        palm leaves, and bones.

        During the caliphate of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), the
        Quran was compiled into a single book under the supervision of Zaid bin
        Thabit, a leading scribe. This task was initiated after the Battle of
        Yamama, where many Quran memorizers were martyred, ensuring the Quran’s
        preservation for future generations.

        The Quran’s memorization tradition is unparalleled. Millions of Muslims
        worldwide have memorized it in its entirety, earning the title of
        <strong>Hafiz</strong>. This practice, passed down through generations,
        has safeguarded the Quran’s authenticity. Remarkably, regardless of
        geographic or cultural differences, Muslims recite the Quran in its
        original Arabic language without a single discrepancy.

        The Quran is also preserved through its manuscripts.
        <strong>The Birmingham Quran manuscript</strong>, housed at the
        University of Birmingham, is considered one of the oldest Quran
        manuscripts in the world, and other historical copies -
        <strong>
          Sana'a manuscript - Discovered in Yemen, Topkapi manuscript - Housed
          in Istanbul, Samarkand Kufic Quran - currently housed in Uzbekistan
        </strong>{" "}
        match the Quran recited today. This enduring consistency further affirms
        its divine preservation as promised in Surah Al-Hijr (15:9):
        <strong>
          “Indeed, it is We who sent down the Quran, and indeed, We will be its
          guardian.”
        </strong>

      <article className="text-lg text-lime-950 mb-6">
        The Quran’s scientific accuracy and the meticulous process of its
        compilation and preservation are testaments to its divine origin.
        Whether reflecting on the universe, human creation, or its preservation,
        the Quran invites humanity to ponder its message and seek knowledge. As
        Allah states in Surah Al-Alaq (96:1):
        <strong>“Read in the name of your Lord who created.”</strong>
      </article>

      <article className="text-lg text-lime-950 mb-6">
        The Quran, revealed over 1,400 years ago, contains numerous verses that
        align with modern scientific discoveries. For instance, in Surah
        Al-Anbiya (21:30), Allah says,
        <strong>
          “Do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined
          together, then We split them apart?”
        </strong>
        This verse remarkably parallels the Big Bang Theory, which describes the
        universe's origin as a singularity that expanded.
      </article>

      <article className="text-lg text-lime-950 mb-6">
        Another scientific insight is found in Surah Az-Zumar (39:5), which
        states,
        <strong>
          “He wraps the night over the day and wraps the day over the night.”
        </strong>
        The use of the word “wrap” implies a spherical Earth, a concept not
        widely accepted at the time of revelation. This subtle indication of the
        Earth's shape showcases the Quran’s divine precision.

      <article className="text-lg text-lime-950 mb-6">
        The Quran also discusses embryology in incredible detail. In Surah
        Al-Mu’minun (23:13-14), Allah describes the stages of human development:
        <strong>
          “Then We placed him as a drop in a firm lodging. Then We made the drop
          into a clot, and We made the clot into a lump, and We made the lump
          bones, and We covered the bones with flesh...”
        </strong>
        Modern embryology, which began to develop centuries after the Quran's
        revelation, confirms this sequence.
